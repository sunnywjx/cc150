cc6.3: You have a five-quart jug,  a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but  
       no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that
       the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be
       impossible.

IDEA:  Step 1--Fill 5-quart jug;
       Step 2--Fill 3-quart jug with 5-quart jug, then there're remain 2 quarts in 5-quart  
               jug;
       Step 3--Empty 3-quart jug, then fill 3-quart jug with 5-quart jug (2 quarts).
       Step 4--Fill 5-quart jug, fill 3-quart jug with 5-quart jug (add 1 more quart). 
               Then, 3-quart jug is full while 5-quart jug has 4 quarts water.
