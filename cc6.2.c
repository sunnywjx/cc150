cc6.2: There is an 8x8 chessboard in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
       You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you
       use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example 
       or showing why it's impossible).

IDEA:    It is 8x8 board, which has 64 squares, but two have been cut off, so the total is down 
       to 62 squares. Originally, the chessboard has 32 white and 32 black squares, since we cut 
       off the opposite corners (which must be the same color), then we're left with 30 of one 
       color and 32 of the other color. 
         However, no matter how we set a domino on the chessboard, it must consume exactly one 
       black and one white squares; thus for 31 dominos, we need 31 white and black squares. But 
       we only have 30 of one color and 32 of the other color. Thus, it is impossible to use 31 
       dominos to cover the entire chessboard!!
